7. For uploading images (photos, avatars) make sure that you have your own AWS account. Create an Amazon S3 bucket for the app and add name of this bucket to `S3_BUCKET_NAME`. Use access key ID and secret access key of your IAM AWS account for adding `S3_ACCESS_KEY` and `S3_SECRET_KEY` respectively.

Using [developers Facebook page](https://developers.facebook.com/) create an app in `My apps` where you must specify `App Domains`, `Contact Email`, `Privacy Policy URL`, than put `+ Add Platform` and choose `Web` where include your own website (you should have your own website or create another free analogues, on Heroku for example) at `Site URL`. Create 1 app for development environment and 1 app for production environment, than use `App ID`s for `FB_APP_ID_DEV` and `FB_APP_ID_PROD`, `App Secret` for `FB_APP_SECRET_DEV` and `FB_APP_SECRET_PROD` respectively.

10. The app use RSpec test, so add your Facebook email, id, name and avatar link to `MY_FB_EMAIL`, `MY_FB_ID`, `MY_FB_NAME` and `MY_FB_IMAGE` respectively. For digging these parameters go to `user.rb`, add `byebug` to the 1 line of `self.find_for_provider_oauth(access_token)` method, execute 
```
$ rails s
``` 
and 
```
$ bin/webpack-dev-server
``` 
(in separate terminal windows), navigate to `http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in` in your browser, put on `Вход через аккаунт Facebook`, put `access_token` (in terminal window where `rails s` has been executed) and than find your parameters.   
11. If you want to make deployment to your vps (Digital Ocean for example), make sure you have configured the vps with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc. and execute 
```
$ bundle exec cap production deploy
